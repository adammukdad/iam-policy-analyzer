# IAM Policy Analyzer ‚Äì Detect Overly Permissive Cloud Access

This tool inspects AWS IAM policies to identify overly broad permissions that could pose security risks. It analyzes access controls to flag wildcard privileges, broad resource exposure, and excessive permissions across user and role policies.

üîç Use case: Surface dangerous `*:*` policies or unchecked access granted to sensitive AWS services.


### **Purpose**

This project was created to simulate real-world AWS IAM policy audits. Its goal is to identify and evaluate overly permissive configurations that violate the principle of least privilege. I wanted to develop a hands-on tool that could parse JSON-based IAM policies, flag dangerous permissions, and help visualize the impact of insecure access rules.

### **Tools Used**

- **Python 3.12** ‚Äî Primary scripting language

- **Tkinter** ‚Äî For graphical user interface (GUI)

- **AWS IAM Policy Format (JSON)** ‚Äî Target audit structure

- **VS Code & PowerShell** ‚Äî Development environment

### **Objectives**

- Detect wildcard actions and resources (`*`) in IAM policies

- Score each policy‚Äôs risk based on the number of violations

- Provide clear, readable audit reports via CLI, CSV, and GUI

- Remediate and validate corrected (least-privilege) policies

- Deliver a full-featured security tool with professional documentation

### **Who / What / When / Where / Why / How**

- **Who:** Built and tested by Adam Mukdad

- **What:** A Python-based IAM auditing tool

- **When:** Completed in May 2025

- **Where:** Developed locally and validated using simulated IAM policies

- **Why:** To showcase practical security auditing and automation skills

- **How:** Through scripting, UI development, testing, and reporting (see screenshots below)

### **Step-by-Step Process**

1. **Created 3 insecure IAM policies** that simulate real-world misconfigurations (e.g., `"Action": "*"` and `"Resource": "*"`).

3. **Developed the initial Python script** to parse policy files, detect violations, and print results to the terminal.

5. **Added risk scoring logic** to rate each policy from Low to High based on the number of violations.

7. **Exported analysis results to CSV**, generating a professional audit report with clear, structured output.

9. **Created 3 remediated secure policy files**, then re-tested them to verify compliance.

11. **Built a graphical user interface (GUI)** using Tkinter, allowing folder selection, output display, and CSV export ‚Äî all with one click.

13. **Validated the tool end-to-end**, ensuring it caught insecure files while passing secure ones.

### **Core Analyzer Script (CLI Version)**

This 37-line script scans IAM policy JSON files, flags risky configurations, assigns a risk score, and exports the results to a CSV file.

```python
import os, json, csv

def load_policy(path): return json.load(open(path))

def analyze_policy(policy):
    findings, stmts = [], policy.get("Statement", [])
    if not isinstance(stmts, list): stmts = [stmts]
    for stmt in stmts:
        a, r, e, c = stmt.get("Action"), stmt.get("Resource"), stmt.get("Effect"), stmt.get("Condition", None)
        if a == "*" or (isinstance(a, list) and "*" in a): findings.append("Unrestricted action: '*'")
        if r == "*": findings.append("Unrestricted resource: '*'")
        if e == "Allow" and a == "*" and r == "*" and not c: findings.append("FULL access (Allow '*' on '*' with no condition)")
    return findings

def risk_level(f): return ["None", "Low", "Moderate", "High"][min(len(f), 3)]

def scan_folder(name, data):
    print(f"\n=== Scanning {name} ===")
    for file in os.listdir(name):
        if not file.endswith(".json"): continue
        try:
            policy = load_policy(os.path.join(name, file))
            findings = analyze_policy(policy)
            risk = risk_level(findings)
            print(f"\n[{file}] ‚Äî Risk: {risk}")
            [print(f"  - {v}") for v in findings] if findings else print("  No issues found.")
            data.append([file, name, "No" if findings else "Yes", risk, "; ".join(findings) or "None"])
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"  Error reading {file}: {e}")
            data.append([file, name, "Error", "N/A", f"Error reading file: {e}"])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    rows = [["Filename", "Folder", "Is Secure", "Risk Level", "Violations"]]
    [scan_folder(f, rows) for f in ["test_policies", "secure_policies"]]
    with open("iam_audit_report.csv", "w", newline='') as f: csv.writer(f).writerows(rows)
    print("\n‚úÖ Results exported to iam_audit_report.csv")

```

### **GUI Version (Tkinter)**

This 63-line script wraps the same logic into a clean GUI, allowing folder selection, analysis display, and CSV export in a user-friendly window.

```python
import os, json, csv, tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog, scrolledtext, messagebox

results = []

def analyze(p):
    f = []; s = p.get("Statement", [])
    if not isinstance(s, list): s = [s]
    for stmt in s:
        a, r, e, c = stmt.get("Action"), stmt.get("Resource"), stmt.get("Effect"), stmt.get("Condition", None)
        if a == "*" or (isinstance(a, list) and "*" in a): f.append("Unrestricted action: '*'")
        if r == "*": f.append("Unrestricted resource: '*'")
        if e == "Allow" and a == "*" and r == "*" and not c: f.append("FULL access (Allow '*' on '*' with no condition)")
    return f

def risk(f): return ["None", "Low", "Moderate", "High"][min(len(f), 3)]

def run():
    folder = filedialog.askdirectory(); output.delete(1.0, tk.END); results.clear()
    if not folder: return
    output.insert(tk.END, f"Scanning folder: {folder}\n\n")
    for f in os.listdir(folder):
        if not f.endswith(".json"): continue
        try:
            policy = json.load(open(os.path.join(folder, f)))
            v = analyze(policy); r = risk(v)
            output.insert(tk.END, f"[{f}] ‚Äî Risk: {r}\n")
            [output.insert(tk.END, f"  - {x}\n") for x in v] if v else output.insert(tk.END, "  No issues found.\n")
            results.append([f, os.path.basename(folder), "No" if v else "Yes", r, "; ".join(v) or "None"])
            output.insert(tk.END, "\n")
        except Exception as e:
            results.append([f, os.path.basename(folder), "Error", "N/A", str(e)])
            output.insert(tk.END, f"[{f}] ‚Äî Error: {e}\n\n")

def export():
    if not results:
        messagebox.showwarning("No Data", "Run an analysis first.")
        return
    path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(
        defaultextension=".csv", filetypes=[("CSV files", "*.csv")], title="Save Audit Report As"
    )
    if not path: return
    with open(path, 'w', newline='') as f:
        writer = csv.writer(f)
        writer.writerow(["Filename", "Folder", "Is Secure", "Risk Level", "Violations"])
        writer.writerows(results)
    messagebox.showinfo("Export Complete", f"Audit results saved to:\n{path}")

# GUI Setup
root = tk.Tk(); root.title("IAM Policy Analyzer"); root.geometry("800x800")

frame = tk.Frame(root)
frame.pack(fill=tk.BOTH, expand=True, padx=10, pady=10)

tk.Button(frame, text="Select Folder & Run Analysis", command=run).pack(pady=(0, 10))

output = scrolledtext.ScrolledText(frame, wrap=tk.WORD, font=('Consolas', 10))
output.pack(fill=tk.BOTH, expand=True)

tk.Button(root, text="Export Results to CSV", command=export).pack(pady=(5, 10))

root.mainloop()

```
